## 1. Revision
Explain what each of the following C programs does:

a)   Takes in a number from inputed from the terminal and assigns it the variable "number"
    It runs through an else if loop and outputs different strings based on what the value of the 
    number is.

b)  i) Takes an input from the terminal and then counts up in steps of 1 to the number.
    ii) How could you replace the while loop?
        int i
        if (i=0; i < count, i++) {
        prinf("%d", i);
        i++;
        }
c)  readInt function prints a string and gets an int from the user and returns the value.
    printInt takes an integer argument and prints it.
    The main function finds the difference of squares between two values read in from the user
    and prints that value and returns 0

## 2. Forward declarations
a)  There is no need for a forward declaration
b)  Where n is the number of functions n-1 forward declarations are required
c)  No forward declarations are required
d)  3 forward declarations are required
